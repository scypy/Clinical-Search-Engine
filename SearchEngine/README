Make sure data directory contains "relevancejudgement.txt" and "topics.nxml"

Run main.py

You can use an alternate query in the main.py file by simply grabbing a topic summary or inputting your own, however, the evaluator already uses all possible queries from the queries.db.

Retrieved Documents are the top 10 k documents most relevant to query.

Evaluator is a dictionary structured by the query topic number and metrics.
All queries (structured by up to 30 topic numbers) are used in the retrieval along with their evaluation metrics.

NOTE:
1. IndexingModule has been commented out as the index is already cached and present in the root directory.
Uncomment if you wish to create a new index.
2. Due to the sheer size, the raw data repository has been excluded from submission and is not needed as they have been parsed and saved in the documents.db file
This means that the DocumentsDB.py file will not work (redundant for searching).
